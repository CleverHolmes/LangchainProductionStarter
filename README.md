# Multi-Modal LangChain agents in Production

This project contains the necessary scaffolding to deploy LangChain conversation agents with memory and connect them to Telegram.

## Usage 🛠️

Getting your agent online only takes 4 steps. If not, shoot me a message on [Discord](https://steamship.com/discord). Happy to help you out. 

1. Clone the repository
2. Add your agent to `src/api.py`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install --upgrade steamship_langchain`
4. Run `python deploy.py`

## Happy building! 🎉
