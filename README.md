# : Deploying Multi-Modal LangChain Agents

This project contains the necessary scaffolding to deploy LangChain conversation agents with memory and connect them to
Telegram.

These 4 steps should get you online. If not, shoot me a message on [Discord](https://steamship.com/discord). Happy to
help you out.

Let's go:

> Step 1: Just copy and paste your LangChain agent into `src/chatbot/get_agent`


> Step 2: Pip-install the latest `steamship_langchain`: `pip install --upgrade steamship_langchain`


> Step 3: Run `python deploy.py`
